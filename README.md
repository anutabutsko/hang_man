## Description

Hangman is a classic word guessing game that has been enjoyed by players of all ages for decades. The game is simple yet entertaining and can be easily implemented using the Python programming language.

In this version of the game, the system generates a random word for the player to guess. The player's objective is to correctly guess the word before the entire hangman is drawn on the screen, at which point the player loses the game.

Upon starting the game, the program will prompt the player for their name and display a welcome message with instructions on how to play the game. The program will then inform the player of the number of letters in the word to be guessed and prompt the player to enter their first letter guess. The program will keep track of all letters entered by the player, correcting them if they enter the same letter more than once. Additionally, the program will keep track of the number of attempts it takes for the player to correctly guess the word.

Each game, the player is allotted 6 tries to correctly guess the word, regardless of the length of the word. This allows for a fair game experience for players, as the challenge of guessing a longer word is balanced by the increased number of chances to guess it. Additionally, the program can be enhanced by incorporating a feature that penalizes the player for guessing the same letter more than once, further increasing the difficulty of the game.

At the end of the game, if the player is able to correctly guess the word, the program will display a congratulation message and end the game. The program can also keep track of the player's score, number of attempts taken to guess the word, which can be used to create leaderboards and competitions among players.

However, if the player is not able to correctly guess the word within 6 tries, the program will display a message indicating that the player has lost the game and end the game by displaying the fully drawn hangman. This serves as a visual representation of the player's progress throughout the game and also serves as a reminder of the player's failure to correctly guess the word.

In conclusion, Hangman is a classic word guessing game that can be easily implemented in Python. It is a great way for players to practice their problem-solving skills, improve their vocabulary, and have fun. The game can be easily customized by adding new features and rules, such as allowing the player to guess the entire word or phrase or keeping track of the player's score and number of attempts. The game can also be enhanced by saving the game so the player can continue where they left off. Overall, this version of Hangman provides a fun and challenging experience for players of all ages and skill levels. Have fun!
